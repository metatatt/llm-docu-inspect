It’s good practice to make work orders as detailed as possible to avoid your team having to stop and ask for clarification.\r\n\r\nComponents of a work order\r\nSimilar to a project plan, a work order is a one-stop shop for all the details about a task, such as the cost of parts and labor. This makes it a handy tool for employees to quickly determine their responsibilities, as well as for accounting purposes. An effective work order must contain all the information for workers to carry out the tasks being requested.
